  how:
    title: What now?
    description: We were trying to do an ICO for our project and we realised that there is not much information about how to do it right. There are not tutorials available, only a few blogposts that never go into details. We are a team of technical people and we like to make informed decissions and clear tasks. We decided to try an ICO ourselves and to write everything that we are going to experience on a book. We will be larning on the way and we hope you also want to learn with us. These are the steps we will follow.
    steps:
      - Investigate, learn, read, open and honest communication
      - Offer something in return for the invested money… maybe a comprehensive book? A book to teach you how we did it. Not only tell you how, we will guide you step by step, with code repositories, examples and everything you will need
      - Send you the book as the return on your investment so you can safely and without obstacles do the ICO you need for your own project
      - The book will be also available after the sale, so the project we'll keep growing afterwards.

    - name: Prepare Using My Ether Wallet
      questions:
        - question: Why can’t I see my balances when I unlock my wallet?
          answer: This is most likely due to the fact that you are behind a firewall. It is common for the API that is used to display the balance to be blocked by firewalls. You will still be able to send transactions, but you will need to use a blockchain explorer, such as Etherscan, to view your balance
        - question: Why can’t I see the account I have just created in the blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherchain, Etherscan)?
          answer: Only active accounts are visible in a blockchain explorer. Once you have transferred some ETH into the  account, it should be visible.
        - question: How does MyEtherWallet actually work?
          answer: "Please check this page: https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-does-myetherwallet-actually-work"
        - question: "I am trying to unlock my wallet but it keeps freezing / hanging"
          answer: "Sorry you are having trouble. Decrypting the keystore files is an intensive process and doesn't enjoy being done in Javascript. We recommend: <br>1.Using Google Chrome.<br>2.Clicking \"continue\" when you see the unresponsive error alert pop up.\n3.Closing other intensive programs open (a lot of browser tabs, video games, etc.).<br>The combination of the above typically eliminates the problem. If it doesn't, please contact us and include your browser and OS so we can advise from there"
        - question: Why am I seeing two different versions of my Ethereum address--one with uppercase letters and one with lowercase letters?
          answer: Capitalization simply means the address has a checksum, which will detect input errors. Both addresses refer to the same wallet and are fully functional.\n The address containing lowercase letters is not checksummed. Mistyping a letter or number in this address can result in the loss of ETH. On the other hand, the upper case checksummed version of the address will detect typos and inform you of an invalid address.For this reason, MyEtherWallet warns you when your address is not checksummed. \nRemember to double check the address to prevent any issues.If you are sending ETH to one of your own wallets, you can save the checksummed address via the "View Wallet Info" page and copy the address displayed there.
