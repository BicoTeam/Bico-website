      - title: "What's the story?"
        description: At the beginning we were trying to do an ICO for another project, one that aims to help mother nature (don't worry you'll know what it is soon), and we realised that there was not enough information about how to do it right, until now!. There are no tutorials available, only a few blogposts that never go into details. <br> <br>We are a team of technical people and we like to make informed decisions and clear tasks, so we decided to try an ICO ourselves and to write everything that we went through in a book. Why a book? Because books are the greatest sources of human knowledge, and every human being has a natural thrust for knowledge. Our ultimate goal is to teach how to do an ICO properly and also not screw our future goal, which will be to help out planting trees.
      - title: "What's BICO?"
        description:  "BICO represents big things. BICO is the world's first token used to fund a book. You can think of BICO as a learning mechanism. Buying BICO will not only allow you to immerse yourself in the world of ICOs, but you will also be supporting a democratic and distributed knowledge sharing platform. You will help transform ICOs so they become accessible to everybody and perceived as a regular way of funding your own startup."
      - title: "What's the plan?"
        description: "We, together with you, will bring clarity, knowledge and information to the world of cryptocurrencies by following a token utility model, where the token is used to purchase services or products in the platform, in our case, the ICO guidebook. This ensures that the token has an inherent value and there will be sustained demand for the token once the book is launched. We encourage a continuous, public, constructive and critical feedback about BICO and the book, so please don't hesitate to contact us. We would love for you to learn with us in the process. These are the steps we will follow."
    steps:
      - title: "LEARN"
        description: "Investigate, learn, read, open and honest communication. Get in touch with already successful ICOs to learn from them."
      - title: "DO"
        description: "Carry on our own ICO, bringing the knowledge to practise. Token utility model: Offer something in return for the invested money… maybe a comprehensive book? A book to teach you how we did it. Not only tell you how, we will guide you step by step, with code repositories, examples and everything you will need"
      - title: "SHARE"
        description: "Share the knowledge for everybody to benefit from it. We will send you the book as the return on your investment so you can safely and without obstacles do the ICO you need for your own project. Encourage the 'arts' and 'writers' to get funding from ICOs."
      - title: "NEXT"
        description: "The book will also be available after the crowdsale in the most popular book platforms, so the project will keep growing afterwards keeping up with the demand, translating this into a more valuable token. Cheaper to buy with BICO than in book shops with regular money."
  tokens:
    title: Token distribution
    description: "Because you have a lot of questions in this new Ethereum and cryptocurrency ecosystem, because you want a world where knowledge is evenly distributed and accessible, because you want to support us so we can all learn together, invest now and join the BICO community. Everybody who buys 1500 BICOs or more by the end of the crowdsale will be able to exchange the tokens to get the guidebook. Only people who have subscribed and joined the community will get access to the Pre-Sale event, where 10% of the number of tokens in regulation will be sold at half the price."

    - name: About BICO
      questions:
        - question: What can I do with BICO?
          answer: BICO is a standard ERC20 token. You can hold it and transfer it
        - question: Will BICO be traded on any exchanges?
          answer: If everything goes as planned it should.
        - question: How many BICO tokens will be available in the crowdsale and how many will be created in total?
          answer: 5 million BICO tokens will be created from which 2.5 million will be in regulation for sale. During the Pre-Sale (only accessible to members of the community) 250000 tokens will be available.
        - question: How can I participate in the crowdsale with ETH?
          answer: 1. Buy ETH on a cryptocurrency exchange, unless already owned.<br>2. Transfer ETH to My Ether Wallet.<br>3. Send a deposit to the payment address (will be established soon).
        - question: Why should I get BICO tokens in the first place?
          answer: Think of BICO as a learning mechanism. Buying BICO will allow you to immerse yourself in the world of ICOs. Also we are the first token to not give you only tokens in return, but an actual product, the complete guide book, with step by step explanations and real case studies to help you invest in ICOs. Don't hesitate to ask us any questions.
        - question: What happens if we don't reach the threshold at the end of the crowdsale?
          answer: "We won't be able to include in the book the steps about 'what happens after an ICO ends successfully', like adding your token to an exchange list, because we won't have the knowledge required."
    - name: The BICO book
      questions:
        - question: Why would I want this book?
          answer: Because you have a lot of questions in this new Ethereum and cryptocurrency ecosystem, because you want a world where knowledge is evenly distributed and accessible, because you want to support us so we can all learn together.
        - question: "I am paying for this book, I want it printed."
          answer: We are in the 21st century. We are eco friendly.
    - name: Timeline
      questions:
        - question: When will BICO crowdsale start?
          answer: "The ICO launches at noon 00:00 UTC on 10th of October, 2017 and closes 1t 00:00 UTC on 10th of November"
        - question: Will you have a Pre-Sale? When will it be?
          answer: Yes there will be a Pre-Sale event taking place in the previous days before the ICO. The exact date will be noticed only via newsletter to the people who have subscribed. During the Pre-Sale you will be able to get extra bonus tokens.
        - question: Why not publicly announce the date of the Pre-Sale?
          answer: We are trying to avoid Hackers and Scammers. Also we want to reward users who have been following us from the beginning.
    - name: Prepare Using My Ether Wallet
      questions:
        - question: Why can’t I see my balances when I unlock my wallet?
          answer: This is most likely due to the fact that you are behind a firewall. It is common for the API that is used to display the balance to be blocked by firewalls. You will still be able to send transactions, but you will need to use a blockchain explorer, such as Etherscan, to view your balance
        - question: Why can’t I see the account I have just created in the blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherchain, Etherscan)?
          answer: Only active accounts are visible in a blockchain explorer. Once you have transferred some ETH into the  account, it should be visible.
        - question: How does MyEtherWallet actually work?
          answer: "Please check this page: <a style='text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank' href='https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-does-myetherwallet-actually-work'>MyEtherWallet Wiki</a>"
        - question: I am trying to unlock my wallet but it keeps freezing / hanging
          answer: "Sorry you are having trouble. Decrypting the keystore files is an intensive process and doesn't enjoy being done in Javascript. We recommend: <br>1.Using Google Chrome.<br>2.Clicking continue when you see the unresponsive error alert pop up.<br>3.Closing other intensive programs open (a lot of browser tabs, video games, etc.).<br>The combination of the above typically eliminates the problem. If it doesn't, please contact us and include your browser and OS so we can advise from there"
        - question: Why am I seeing two different versions of my Ethereum address--one with uppercase letters and one with lowercase letters?
          answer: Capitalization simply means the address has a checksum, which will detect input errors. Both addresses refer to the same wallet and are fully functional.<br> The address containing lowercase letters is not checksummed. Mistyping a letter or number in this address can result in the loss of ETH. On the other hand, the upper case checksummed version of the address will detect typos and inform you of an invalid address.For this reason, MyEtherWallet warns you when your address is not checksummed. <br>Remember to double check the address to prevent any issues.If you are sending ETH to one of your own wallets, you can save the checksummed address via the "View Wallet Info" page and copy the address displayed there.
